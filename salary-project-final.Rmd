# Introduction

**Description:** Our goal with this Modern Salary Modeling Project is to analyze modern-day jobs (most are related to AI) to attempt to make salary predictions, looking at the influence of different variables on job salaries. This notebook will use the F-statistic and a series of ANOVA tests (hypothesis and confidence intervals)to determine the best predictors for the job market of the future.
